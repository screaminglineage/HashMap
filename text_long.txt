The sun was setting over the horizon, and the sky turned a brilliant orange. Birds were flying across the open sky, their wings catching the last rays of sunlight. A cool breeze blew through the trees, rustling the leaves gently. People walked along the park path, chatting and laughing as children played nearby. The sound of footsteps on gravel mixed with distant music, creating a peaceful rhythm. It was the kind of evening that felt timeless, where everything seemed to align perfectly, even if only for a moment.
